 Troubleshooting
1- Error  "Invoke-sqlcmd' command was found in the module  'SQLPs', but the module could not be loaded ...
   it means  the sqlserver PS module is not loaded into your system
    To install the PowerShell module for SQL server, first make sure you start PowerShell as admin.
    then run below command separately
      1-Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned

      2-Install-module -Name sqlserver

      3-Import-Module sqlserver -DisableNameChecking;

    Once this is done you can verify that  sqlserver module has been successful by running blow  command 

    Get-Module -name sqlserver 
2- Invoke-sqlcmd : Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.SqlServer.BatchParser
   Try to run  the sript or the bat file as administrator 
3-Error Error

 This error is due to a new update for Powershell where encryption is mandatory by default. the fix to this is to add -encrypt optional to the invoke-sqlcmd command 
 please reach out if you are getting this error.
